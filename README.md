# S3 plugin for Redmine/RedMica

[![Test](https://github.com/redmica/redmica_s3/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/redmica/redmica_s3/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Description
This [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) plugin makes file attachments be stored on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) rather than on the local filesystem. This is a fork for [original gem](http://github.com/tigrish/redmine_s3) and difference is that this one supports [RedMica](https://github.com/redmica/redmica) 4.0.2 or later(compatible with Redmine 6.1.1 or later)

## Installation
1. Make sure Redmine is installed and cd into it's root directory
2. `git clone https://github.com/redmica/redmica_s3.git plugins/redmica_s3`
3. `cp plugins/redmica_s3/config/s3.yml.example config/s3.yml`
4. Edit config/s3.yml with your favourite editor
5. `bundle install --without development test` for installing this plugin dependencies (if you already did it, doing a `bundle install` again would do no harm)
6. Restart web server/upload to production/whatever
7. *Optional*: Run `rake redmica_s3:files_to_s3` to upload files in your files folder to s3
